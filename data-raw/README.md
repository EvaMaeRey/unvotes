## data-raw folder

This folder contains the raw data files downloaded from the United Nations dataset [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=hdl:1902.1/12379), as well as the script, [un-data.R](un-data.R), that processes and saves them. (Run the script in the package's main directory).

The two files are `RawVotingdata.RData` and `descriptionsnew.xls`. They were downloaded on July 7, 2016, and attempts will be made to update them appropriately when new versions of the dataset are released.

(Note that as listed on the Terms page [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=hdl:1902.1/12379), the data files are dedicated to the public domain under the CC0 license).
